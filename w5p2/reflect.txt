Workshop 5 was about the helper functions, the member operators, and the friedship.
In the workshop many functions were provided like the display function, the setempty, and the
constructors were also given along side with the destructor. We had to mainly overload
the operators like +=, -=, >>, << and many more. Then we used the bool operator, that was 
used to see if the type of portfolio was a correct one or not, so it returned true if it 
was correct and false if it wasn't. Then we have the int, char, char* and double operator
that just returns the class members of that type.
In this workshop I got some difficulties to do the << and the >> operators, actually they
were almost the same, when i finished the first one I've easily made the second one.
The difficulty that i met was that I wasn't changing the value of the m_values/ m_passengers
in the correct way. I was not changing the value of the one that needed to be set to 0, 
that didn't allow me to get the correct output.
