This workshop 4 the main topic was the constructors and the destructors, we learned about default constructors that in a certain way 
initializes the class's variables to safe empty state. On the other side the destructor deallocates the allocated variables, the name of 
the destructor is ~ with the name of the class. The destructor is called automatically, so there is no need to call it in the main 
function.
In this workshop we also used the this keyword, that represents the current object's address and in the workshop we used *this to return
the object itself and not its address. The current address is the location of the memory where the member function is operating.
In this workshop I found difficulties in the DIY part because the output expected initially wasn't matching, I had to try multiple times to
print the exact same format that was required in the display function. The rest I would say wasn't that challenging because those were 
topics that we studied in the previous workshops.
