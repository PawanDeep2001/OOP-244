Workshop 10 was pretty easy, most of the modules were given and we just needed to create
a couple of functions, the others were pretty much the same as the previous ones, the only
the difference was the object we had to use, the only thing I took a little bit of time to 
understand was that we need to implement everything in the header file without the c++ file.
The select functions were pretty easy just a loop to check if the to go through all the 
elements of the array and then compare them with the element in the argument. The print
function on the other side just had to print the title given as an argument, and then in a loop 
through all the elements of the collection till \n. I didn't face many difficulties, but it was
a different type of topic, and I took a long time to understand the meaning of this template 
topic.
