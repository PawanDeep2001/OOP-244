workshop 8 and milestone 3 were about the virtual functions mainly, in those workshops, first
of all I had to create all the virtual functions, to create a function I had to add in front 
of the function definition the word virtual and in the after the function definition, if it
is a pure virtual function =0, otherwise just give an empty body to that function, for 
example in our case in the workshop I had to add to the destructor an empty body and fof the
other functions just =0; The base module normally just has the << and >> operators overload,
as gloabal functions, and it just calls the class function to display or read whatever the
user enters in the console or whatever we need to display into console.
A difficulty that I had in these workshops was mainly the way to read the user input, or the 
format with whom I had to display the data. The rest was pretty much similar to the previous
workshops.
