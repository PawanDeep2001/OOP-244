this workshop was quite difficult, first of all the istream and ostream libraries were not that easy to utilize, because first
of all they are global functions, then we had to read a formatted line, as user input in a certain way and if read from a file 
in a different way, that took some time to get it done, and the print wasn't that difficult. In the workshop part 2 I encountered 
many difficulties, because the instructions were not correct in some points, and sometimes they even misguided me.
The read function of the second part was kind of tricky because it had the possibility of being even 4 words that made the whole 
thing much more difficult.
The first thing was reading part by part till reaching the third word and then if the word had a space after it, we had to make all
the members as invalid. on the other side if there was a new line then we had to save the words that we had.
An other difficulty that i got was the operator += that we had to check many things and if the number of names was greater than 3
than we had to print bad name otherwise we had to add that name accordingly to which names we already have.
