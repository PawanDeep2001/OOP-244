In the workshop 9 and milestone 4 were not very similar, in workshop 9 i had to first of all
to read a file and modify its content to create an html file, first of all I had to read the 
file character by character, then add in the end a '\0' in order not to have any garbage values
when i read the file and save it into my pointer. An error I encountered, that took a long 
time to fix it was that on matrix it was printing till the '\0' and I had to udjust my code
in order to not print anything when the return value of the operator[] was '\0', that '\0'
was printing everything on matrix but wasn't saving the last 2 lines into it because when 
the '\0' was read everything was stopping. milestone 4 on the other side wasn't that difficult
just by using previous knowledge we were able to make it. I didn't encounter any difficulty 
while doing this milestone.
