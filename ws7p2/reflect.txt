workshop 7 and milestone 2 had pretty much similar topics.
workshop 7 it was mostly about our previous knowledge and the inherit topic and derived classes, that made us use the base class 
member functions, how to use the constructor of the base class. the constructor was pretty easy we had to first of all include
in the header file the header file of the constructor module, then we had to add in the class :public Constructor, to access 
all the public members of the Constructor class in the Pack class, then the Pack constructor also had to initialize the variables 
related to the Container, i just added to the function definition :Container(content, size * unitsize, unitsize * number) with 
the calculations required as arguments of the Container constructor. 
After that we had call += operator of Container in the += operator of Pack and same thing in the -= operator, it was pretty much
the same as the contructor, only thing here the return value was saved into an int variable, the rest of the logic was just 
about previous knowledge. This workshop was a bit easier because there was no chance of memory leak because no variable was 
dinamically allocated.
