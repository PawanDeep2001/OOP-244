    I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

the second workshop was quite challenging, we had a very long char to work with, in the starting I was saving all the data in a struct,
but that would have took too much time to processing, so I decided to create a normal char variable and compared the char with the user 
input, then the matches were saved in the struct, after saving them in the struct we needed to sort them by their id, then printed them.
The data leak part was quite challenging for me because I didn't know exactly what was wrong in the program, then while checking my code
again I was looking properly for every new if I have its delete, then an other thing was understanding the difference between delete[]
and delete, that wasn't that difficult in the end.
In the end the coding part itself wasn't as difficult as the memory leak one because it was the first time I was facing this topic.
Now I suppose whenever I will face the data leak issue I will be able to deal with it much earlier. It was quite difficut to identify
because like other errors this is not displayed on the errors of visual studio while debugging
