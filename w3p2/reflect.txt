This workshop was mainly about the classes that by deafault are private, I declared some member variables, and some member functions,
the variables are private, on the other side the functions were public, in this workshop I learned how to deal with classes and private
members. One of the function was a global function, I would say that in the first moment I got some difficulties in how can I deal with
global function but after understanding the main function I got to know that I have already the 2 train as a parameter and with the
two new functions reated in the workshop part 2 it is pretty simple to update the number of people in the 2 trains.
I would say that the main function helped me a lot to understand all the functions, because I knew what were the parameters and what 
exactly the text requires from me. Only with the workshop text maybe it would have been a little bit more complex.
Then, I set position to 2 for the speed because if I wouldn't do that whenever the number had no decimal number it became an
integer number and it didn't show the kms decimal numbers so for example 170,00 was displayed 170 with setprecision(2) 170,00.
